# News Wall

**News Wall** is a macOS application that turns your screen into a customizable video wall of live news channels.  
Instead of opening dozens of YouTube tabs, you can arrange multiple streams in a grid, switch audio focus between them, and manage channels directly from the app.

## Features

- **Grid of Streams** – Watch 2×2 up to 4×4 YouTube live channels simultaneously.  
- **One-Audio Rule** – Only the active tile plays sound; all others remain muted.  
- **Keyboard Controls** –  
  - Arrows: move active selection  
  - `Cmd+←/→`: flip pages  
  - Space: enforce one-audio rule  
  - `M`: global mute toggle  
  - `R`: reload active tile  
  - `C`: toggle player controls
- **Mouse Controls** – Click a tile to activate its audio.  
- **Channel Management** – Add/remove/edit YouTube links from a dedicated Channels window.  
- **Watchdog** – Detects stalled streams and reloads them automatically.
